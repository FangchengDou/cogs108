    "As a student at school, I am about to step out of the society and enter the workplace. In the current era of inflation, various prices are increasing rapidly.",
    "We have to start planning for our future. For some people, there are times in life. There are many major events, one of which is to own your own house. ",
    "But the price of a house depends on many reasons, which is dazzling, and even most people cannot accurately estimate the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are devoted to analyzing the price of houses in California and the differences in house prices caused by various factors. ",
    "We are interested in this because many graduates are complaining about the increase in house prices and the false quotations caused by people's unprepared perception of the value of houses.",
    "It is also a factor that causes market confusion. Some people miss their favorite houses because they donâ€™t know the specific value of the house.",
    "Therefore, we think such a data that predicts house prices can help people get more information and get a general understanding when buying a house. ",
    "The Los Angeles Metro Area had a year-over-year price gain of 11.7 percent, with the median price being 725,000 dollars. \n(1)",
    "The typical home value of homes in California is 774,899 dollars. This value is seasonally adjusted and only includes the middle price tier of homes.\n",
    "California home values have gone up 22.0% over the past year.\n(2)",
    "\n",
    "These increases in house prices have caused a lot of stress for us now students, and even we are worried Is it affordable. ",
    "In March 2022, San Diego home prices were up 28.6% compared to last year, selling for a median price of $900K. ",
    "On average, homes in San Diego sell after 8 days on the market compared to 9 days last year. ",


    "There were 1,351 homes sold in March this year, down from 1,484 last year. (3) ",
    "So we should understand the market as early as possible, and use this to help us prepare to locate the house price, ",
    "if we meet the right one, we can seize the opportunity.\n",
